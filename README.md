## Milestone 1
In this milestone, you are asked to implement a basic interpreter using JAVA. You have a text file that represents a program. When you read that text file and start executing it, it becomes a process. You are asked to write 5 programs, and execute them. Your programs should include normal instructions as well as system calls.

 Types of system calls required: <br>
(a) Read the data of any file from the disk. <br>
(b) Write text output to a file in the disk. <br>
(c) Print data on the screen. <br>
(d) Take text input from the user. <br>
(e) Reading data from memory. (f) Writing data to memory. <br>

## Milestone 2

In this milestone, you are asked to create these three scheduling algorithms using JAVA:<br>
1. First Come First Serve (FCFS): Processes are executed on first come, first serve basis (queue, based on arrival time).<br>
2. Shortest Job First (non-preemptive): Processes are executed depending on their execution time, the shortest process being the first to execute. The processor should know in advance how much time each process needs for execution, so that it can order the processes accordingly.<br>
3. Round Robin: Each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way.<br>
