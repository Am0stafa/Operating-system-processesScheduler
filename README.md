Implemented the different memory management algorithms simulating the impact of paging, fragmentation, and segmentation. Coded the different processes scheduling algorithms \
1. First Come First Serve (FCFS): Processes are executed on first come, first serve basis (queue, based on arrival time).<br>
2. Shortest Job First (non-preemptive): Processes are executed depending on their execution time, the shortest process being the first to execute. The processor should know in advance how much time each process needs for execution, so that it can order the processes accordingly.<br>
3. Round Robin: Each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way.<br>
